## what is this?

**pid1.club** is a community for linux users, open-source contributors, and infosec learners.  
a space to learn, build, and break systems — together ♡

- linux, nix, and foss
- cybersecurity and ethical hacking
- devops, scripting, infra tools
- dotfiles, automation, and terminal craft

---

## what we do (or will do)

- dotfile setups, ricing, shell tools  
- ctf prep and exploit labs  
- contributions to open source and documentation  
- infra tooling and self-hosted scripts  
- writeups, meetups and knowledge sharing
- participate in hackathons, events and what not

---

## philosophy

every linux system starts with **pid 1** —  
we start from the same place: clarity, openness, and control.

we believe in:

- building in the open  
- learning by debugging  
- respecting the hacker ethic  
- sharing knowledge without gatekeeping
